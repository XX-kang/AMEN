=============================AMEN Matlab Code============================

0.This package contains the source code for the following paper:
   Attention Model Enhanced Network for Classification of Breast Cancer Image 

1.We implement AMEN on Python.

2.Description:
    train.py:                 get the classification result of backbone on each scale.
    cam_save:                 get the attention map on each scale.
    main_new.py:              run the main to achieve iterative training strategy.
    augmentor:                include the data augmentation tools.
    ptclassfication:          include diffierent backbone which used in our AMEN.
